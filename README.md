## Overview:
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn for SyriaTel, a telecommunications company. Customer churn poses a significant challenge in the telecommunications industry, leading to revenue loss and affecting a company's market position. By accurately predicting churn, SyriaTel can implement proactive retention strategies to mitigate its financial impact and improve customer satisfaction.

## Project Phases:

### Business Understanding:
Identify the problem of customer churn in the telecommunications industry and its impact on SyriaTel's financial performance and market position. Define the objective of developing a classifier to predict customer churn and aid in implementing proactive retention strategies.

### Data Understanding:
Obtain a dataset from Kaggle consisting of 21 columns and 3333 rows, containing relevant information for predicting customer churn. Each row represents a customer, and each column represents features related to customer behavior, demographics, and interactions with SyriaTel's services.

### Data Preparation:
Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features and identify potential correlations with customer churn.

### Modeling:
Train multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict customer churn. Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC ROC.

### Evaluation:
XGBoost model is the best performing model for predicting customer churn. Evaluate its performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC ROC, compared to other algorithms.

### Conclusion:
XGBoost is the most suitable model for predicting customer churn, exhibiting superior accuracy and AUC score compared to other algorithms. Emphasize the importance of rigorous evaluation and model selection in addressing the problem of customer churn.

### Recommendation:
Provide recommendations for SyriaTel to reduce customer churn, including implementing proactive retention strategies, improving service quality, enhancing communication channels, and leveraging data-driven decision-making.

### Next Steps:
refining models for better predictive performance, enriching data with additional relevant features, deploying the final model into production systems, and monitoring its performance over time.

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, to aid in implementing proactive retention strategies. It involves data preparation, model training, evaluation, and recommendations for reducing customer churn. The XGBoost model is identified as the best performing model, with recommendations provided for SyriaTel to improve customer retention and leverage data-driven decision-making. Future steps include refining models, enriching data, deploying the final model, and monitoring its performance.
