    "In the telecommunications industry, customer churn poses a significant challenge for companies like SyriaTel. The objective is to develop a classifier that predicts whether a customer will soon terminate their services with SyriaTel. This binary classification task aims to uncover patterns in customer behavior and demographic data that may indicate a propensity to churn. The ultimate goal is to aid SyriaTel in reducing the financial impact of customer churn by implementing proactive retention strategies."
